# Session ID Handling Analysis - Native Chrome vs Bridge

## Key Findings

### 1. **Critical Difference: Response Session IDs**
- **Native Chrome**: Includes `sessionId` in responses when the command had a `sessionId`
- **Bridge**: Does NOT include `sessionId` in any responses
- This is the primary reason Playwright fails with the bridge

### 2. **Session ID Usage Patterns**

#### Native Chrome:
- Commands with sessionId are sent to specific targets
- Responses to those commands include the same sessionId
- Events from that target include the sessionId
- Example:
  ```json
  // Command
  {"id": 6, "method": "Page.enable", "sessionId": "22DB8BDE7FACC35602D604D1FB91C25C"}
  // Response
  {"id": 6, "result": {}, "sessionId": "22DB8BDE7FACC35602D604D1FB91C25C"}
  ```

#### Bridge:
- Commands with sessionId are received correctly
- But responses omit the sessionId
- Events have a different sessionId format
- Example:
  ```json
  // Command
  {"id": 6, "method": "Page.enable", "sessionId": "15D79AB2FF9F71B7F309295C419B51B1"}
  // Response (MISSING sessionId!)
  {"id": 6, "result": {}}
  ```

### 3. **Multiple Session IDs in Bridge**
The bridge uses two different session IDs:
1. `15D79AB2FF9F71B7F309295C419B51B1` - Used in Target.attachedToTarget and commands
2. `session_654761660_1750067267316` - Used in events (Page.lifecycleEvent, Runtime.executionContextCreated)

This inconsistency likely confuses Playwright.

### 4. **Statistics**
- Native: 28 responses with sessionId, 5 without
- Bridge: 0 responses with sessionId, 14 without

## Required Fixes

1. **Add sessionId to all responses** when the corresponding command had a sessionId
2. **Use consistent session IDs** - the events should use the same sessionId as Target.attachedToTarget
3. **Maintain session context** throughout the command/response cycle

## Impact
Without proper session ID handling, Playwright cannot:
- Route responses to the correct session
- Handle multiple targets properly
- Maintain proper CDP session state
